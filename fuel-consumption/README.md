The explanation of the dashboard:
- we can describe global emission trendlines over the years
- we can filter the dashboard based on `fuel type`, `vehicle class`
- we can explain composition of `average of emissions` by `cylinders`
- we can see the relationship between the parameters `fuel consumption` vs `engine size`
- We can see the differences between `average fuel consumption in city` with `average fuel consumption highway`
